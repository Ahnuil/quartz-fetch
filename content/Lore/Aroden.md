Aroden was an immortal Azlanti Human, the first being to use the Starstone to apotheosize. 

Hailed as a god of mankind, his domains include civilization, law, duty, knowledge, and glory. 

As a lawful god, his divine realm exists in the Eternal City, Axis, on the shores of the Maelstrom near the base of Pharasma's Spire in the Great Beyond. 

Aroden created the realm of [[Shuanti]] to be home to special variety of Shoony. Many of his elite forces and personal servants came from this realm, and it is they who assisted him in his exploration of the Great Beyond until his death. 

Outside of Shuanti, clerics of Aroden no longer receive his blessings, however the realm he created was sustained by magic devices that emulate his divine power, granting his faithful in the plane a nearly identical set of powers.
