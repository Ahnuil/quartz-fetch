#### Role
Emperawr of [[The Shuanti Imperium]]

#### Location
[[Pawlus]]

# Description
A massive and muscled Bernese Mountain Dog, Barktholomew stands a full head taller than most of his subjects. Despite his apparently quite cushy lifestyle, he somehow maintains an intimidating physique. He wears a sleeveless tunic, elaborately embroidered with the imperial crest, two golden bracers, a pair of simple but clearly well-made trousers, and a set of heavy knee-high boots. As befits his station, he also often wears the imperial crown and cloak, though the latter is oft slung in a way that diminishes its grandeur in favor of allowing open access to the massive greatsword he refuses to go without.

# Notes
A chompion of the 93rd Great Fetch, the 94th was initiated in tandem with his coronation, inheriting the imperial crown from his father with the near-unanimous approval of both Councils.
