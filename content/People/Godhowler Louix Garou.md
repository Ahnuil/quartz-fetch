# Description
An old English shepherd of greatly advanced age. His large brown eyes are often hidden beneath his unruly hair, but this strangely does not seem to affect his vision. He dresses most often in the robes of his station: a forest green frock with golden trim and elaborately embroidered passages from Aroden's holy text, *The History and Future of Humanity*. He carries a staff topped with a golden crest of Aroden, and leans on it heavily when he walks.
