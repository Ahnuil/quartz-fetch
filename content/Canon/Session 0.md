# Expectations

## Doors and Curtains

When posting schedules I will list two times: Doors and Curtains. ‘Doors’ is when I will be available and begin setting up the game and making sure everything is ready. If you have something that needs my attention related to the game, this is the best time to ask before the session. This time is also so the players can get set up and settled in and chat before we get into gameplay. ‘Curtains’ is the time the actual game will start. I will generally begin with a brief recap of the previous session, and we will proceed directly to gameplay.

## Snacks/Mic Discipline

If you want to eat during gameplay, that is acceptable, but I will ask you to observe two rules when doing so. First, if you are eating something crunchy or crinkly or otherwise loud, mute your mic. Secondly, do NOT speak with food in your mouth. I have a condition called misophonia that causes some sounds to trigger a rage response in my brain, and these are two of them. Our sessions will likely be in the evenings after my medication has worn off, so moderating the emotional reaction is much more difficult. I will do my best to remind people gently, but if it becomes a recurring issue I will ask you to either not snack during gameplay or to leave the game. 

## Rule Disputes

This game has literal textbooks full of rules. It would be unreasonable to expect everyone to know all of them at all times. There will always be disagreements about what the books say or what the intention of particular phrasing is. To prevent rule disputes from bogging down the game, the following procedure will be followed:

1. I will search the pdf or the wiki for the relevant section

2. If I cannot find the relevant rules in the handbook, I will go with what makes the most sense to me. Please do not argue about this mid-game.

3. If, after the game session, you find the relevant rules or have a suggestion that may work better you may message me about it for future reference, but we will most likely not retcon anything. This is to keep the game running smoothly while we are playing.

## Metagaming

Metagaming is the practice of using knowledge gained out of character when acting in character. Some level of this is unavoidable - it’s just how brains work. I encourage all players to consider what their character would know or be aware of when deciding how to act. If it rises to the level of being a problem, I will speak to the player involved one on one. If it continues to be an issue, they will be asked to leave the game.

## Attention

TTRPGs can be slow sometimes. I do my best to mitigate it, but it’s just the nature of the beast. I encourage you to take notes to keep you engaged in what is going on. If all players agree to it, I will also record the sessions and put the recordings in a folder which everyone can access. To prevent combat being dragged out, we will be implementing a time limit for each player’s turn. This will likely be in the neighborhood of two minutes per turn.

# What’s already decided?

## What level are we starting at?

Characters will start at level 1 for this campaign.

## Where will the campaign be run?

This campaign will be hosted remotely using the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software running on a Forge-VTT server. Players will be sent a link and need to log in/create an account. Your password is for **Forge, *not* Foundry***. You will be able to use this account to log in to any Forge-VTT game you are invited to. If you would like to change your password, it has to be done through your account page on Forge-VTT's website. The server will be active for at least an hour after session and at the doors time. If you need server access outside of these timeframes, contact the DM to boot the server for you.

## How long will a session be?

Sessions will generally run between 2 and 4 hours long, with an approximately 3 hour average. This may shift depending on the decisions we make about the story, but the game will never be longer than 4 hours.

## How will leveling work?
We will be using a milestone leveling system.  

# Safety Tools

In the interest of making sure that everyone has fun and no boundaries get violated, we will be using the following safety tools.

## Lines and Veils

Each player should send me a list of their lines and veils, if they have them. I will compile these all into a list - without attribution - so that players can have their lines and veils respected without necessarily having to reveal that it is their line or veil. A line is a topic which under no circumstances should be present or alluded to during the story. A veil is a topic which may be referenced or alluded to but never happens ‘on-screen’. Both lists will be available both here and as a document on the VTT during gameplay for your reference. The original intention was to avoid topics that would be triggering for players, but I also believe these should be used even for subjects that just make you uncomfortable, as I feel that diminishes the fun of the game.  If a line or veil is crossed in another player’s backstory and it looks like it may become relevant to the plot, I will approach the player whose line or veil that is to see if and/or how we can work it in without it being distressing to anyone. Please note, I will only list a subject once even if multiple players list it as a line or veil. If a subject is veiled for one player but a line for another, it will only be present on the line list.  

### Lines

Excessive, detailed gore

### Veils  

## X Cards

An X card overturns the usual “Yes, and” rule. If a player uses an X card, that subject is dropped immediately and without question. I am working on implementing a method by which players may X card anonymously, until then you may X card by messaging me directly through Discord or with the whisper feature in Foundry if you are not comfortable directly stopping play.

  

# Table Questions

## What should be done if one or more players are absent? Under what conditions do we cancel outright?

## Are there any scenes or settings that we want to specifically see in this game?

## Is PvP allowed? Under what circumstances?

## What is the ‘rating’ for our game? (PG, PG-13, R, etc.)

## How should character death/resurrection be handled?

# House Rules

## What kind of rules do we want to implement for crits and fumbles (Skill crits/fumbles, failing forward, crit/fumble tables, etc)?

## Inspiration

Generally I like to give players ‘inspiration’ (called Hero Points in Pathfinder 2e) for the following:

1. Exceptional Roleplay
2. Clever Solutions
3. Big Character Moments
